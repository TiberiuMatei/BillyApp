## Description
This application was developed in order to apply Python knowledge, GIT workflows, data visualization and learn more at the same time. The application is under the shell of a learning project.
The main purpose was to create applicability - that being a desktop app for tracking consumer bills for selected Romanian electricity, natural gas, internet & TV providers/suppliers and subscriptions. The app functionalities served the purpose of learning more of Python and the creation of UI using Python, data visualization plus the managing of a GIT repository.

The learning project path included working with Python as the main programming language, GIT for project versioning, PySide2 for the UI (layout, animations, widgets, charts, forms and so on), creating a basic, not-so-secure auth service (that includes user creation and authentication), playing around with a simple sqlite db for storing data, reading and extracting data from pdf files with regex, generating charts for data visualization and creating some graphic resources.
